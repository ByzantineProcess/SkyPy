# SkyPy
SkyPy is a horribly coded Python toolbox for Hypixel SkyBlock. 
Currently its main and best feature is finding the best items to reverse-flip from the bazaar to any NPC.
It's possible to use it as a library as well.

### This project is still in development! Features may change unexpectedly.

# Example
dunno why you'd want to though
```
import Sky
Sky.revflip()
```
